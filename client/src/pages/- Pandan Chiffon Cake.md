 ** Japanese Soba Noodle Salad

https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/R25tMghsjq5WSF0QmQei97FVbs8=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/8872286-87dfd2bbd4b24d3eb23ca31507a06c13.jpg

Traditionally, this soba noodle salad is served cold. Mirin is a sweet wine that can be found in most Asian grocery stores. I do not know of any substitute.

15 mins
30 mins

** Japanese Curry

https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/8FfLo363HrdCZ1I94ojJpDvFtmM=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4917776-japanese-curry-MMSVA-4x3-1-ea36281f103d4aa7a7c289714cc498df.jpg

Japanese curry is different from Indian or Thai curries. It is more of a brown stew and it can be mild or spicy, depending on your tastes. The curry roux, from no heat to very spicy, can be bought at any international grocery store. It can be served over white rice or with udon noodles. This recipe is very flexible; it can easily be made for more or less people. It can also be frozen (don't put the potatoes in).

30 mins
1 hr 10 mins
8 servings

1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more as needed
1 ¾ pounds beef chuck, cut into 2-inch cubes
3 onions, quartered
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional)
4 carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces
1 cube chicken bouillon (Optional)
3 medium potatoes, cut into 3-inch chunks
1 ½ (3.5 ounce) containers Japanese curry roux, or more to taste


Heat oil in a 6-quart pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and saute until brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onions and cook until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Add ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to coat. Add cayenne pepper. Pour in water to cover mixture by 1 or 2 inches. Add carrots and bouillon.
Simmer, skimming fat off the surface of the broth as needed, for 30 minutes. Add potatoes. Stir in 1 package of curry roux and let dissolve; add remaining curry as needed to achieve desired thickness. Continue simmering until beef and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more.

Japanese Egg Salad Sandwich (Tamago Sando)

https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/jumpstartpure/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net%2Fv1%2Fstatic%2F1033249144001%2F7f441de9-2d81-4ac8-88ea-eea0fa165c39%2Fdd958f3f-dc30-42ca-97d9-53ba8d2b39c4%2F1280x720%2Fmatch%2Fimage.jpg&w=640&h=360&q=90&c=cc

I'm going to show you my take on the world-famous tamago sando, plus how to make a version of a mayonnaise so addictive, it literally has a cult following. If that wasn't enough, I'm also going to tease an upcoming video for the world's most critically-acclaimed white bread.

10 mins
15 mins
2

2 sandwiches
½ cup mayonnaise
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
¾ teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
3 dashes hot sauce, or to taste
1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 teaspoons rice vinegar
½ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
¼ teaspoon white sugar
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon heavy cream
4 slices soft white bread
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened

Place eggs in the bottom of a saucepan. Add 1/4 inch of water. Heat over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Cover and steam for 11 minutes. Turn off the heat and drain water carefully; pour cold water over and let cool.
Mix mayonnaise, salt, sugar, mustard, hot sauce, lemon juice, and vinegar for Kewpie-style mayonnaise together. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed.
Peel eggs. Mash in a shallow bowl with the side and back of a fork until desired texture is reached. Add salt, sugar, cayenne, heavy cream, and 3 tablespoons Kewpie-style mayonnaise. Stir to combine. Wrap and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 1 hour. Taste and adjust seasonings.
Butter bread slices and use 1/2 of the egg salad on each sandwich. Cut crusts off before serving if you're fancy.

Telur Balado (Spicy Chile Sauce with Eggs)

https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F7634823.jpg&q=60&c=sc&orient=true&poi=auto&h=512

Originated from North Sumatra (Padang or Minang), this humble dish can be easily bought from many street vendors (warung nasi). When I studied abroad, I found a shortcut to make this lovely dish. Serve with hot, steamed rice or Indonesian fried rice (nasi goreng) with prawn crackers on the side.

15 mins
20 mins
6

1 cup vegetable oil for frying
6 hard-boiled eggs, shells removed
6 red chile peppers, seeded and chopped
4 cloves garlic
4 medium shallots
2 tomatoes, quartered
1 teaspoon shrimp paste
1 ½ tablespoons peanut oil
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon white sugar
salt and pepper to taste

Heat 1 cup oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Deep fry the eggs in the hot oil until they are golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes; set aside.
Combine the chile peppers, garlic, shallots, tomatoes, and shrimp paste in a food processor; blend into a paste. Add in peanut oil. Process again until smooth.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pour the chile pepper mixture into the skillet. Stir the vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper into the mixture. Add the fried eggs to the mixture, turning to coat. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until fragrant, about 5 minutes.
